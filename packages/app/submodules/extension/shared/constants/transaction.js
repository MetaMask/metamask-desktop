/**
 * Transaction Type is a MetaMask construct used internally
 *
 * @typedef {object} TransactionTypes
 * @property {'transfer'} TOKEN_METHOD_TRANSFER - A token transaction where the user
 *  is sending tokens that they own to another address
 * @property {'transferfrom'} TOKEN_METHOD_TRANSFER_FROM - A token transaction
 *  transferring tokens from an account that the sender has an allowance of.
 *  For more information on allowances, see the approve type.
 * @property {'safetransferfrom'} TOKEN_METHOD_SAFE_TRANSFER_FROM - A token transaction
 *  transferring tokens from an account that the sender has an allowance of.
 *  The method is prefixed with safe because when calling this method the contract checks
 *  to ensure that the receiver is an address capable of handling with the token being sent.
 * @property {'approve'} TOKEN_METHOD_APPROVE - A token transaction requesting an
 *  allowance of the token to spend on behalf of the user
 * @property {'setapprovalforall'} TOKEN_METHOD_SET_APPROVAL_FOR_ALL - A token transaction requesting an
 *  allowance of all of a user's token to spend on behalf of the user
 * @property {'incoming'} INCOMING - An incoming (deposit) transaction
 * @property {'simpleSend'} SIMPLE_SEND - A transaction sending a network's native asset to a recipient
 * @property {'contractInteraction'} CONTRACT_INTERACTION - A transaction that is
 *  interacting with a smart contract's methods that we have not treated as a special
 *  case, such as approve, transfer, and transferfrom
 * @property {'contractDeployment'} DEPLOY_CONTRACT - A transaction that deployed
 *  a smart contract
 * @property {'swap'} SWAP - A transaction swapping one token for another through
 *  MetaMask Swaps
 * @property {'swapApproval'} SWAP_APPROVAL - Similar to the approve type, a swap
 *  approval is a special case of ERC20 approve method that requests an allowance of
 *  the token to spend on behalf of the user for the MetaMask Swaps contract. The first
 *  swap for any token will have an accompanying swapApproval transaction.
 * @property {'cancel'} CANCEL - A transaction submitted with the same nonce as a
 *  previous transaction, a higher gas price and a zeroed out send amount. Useful
 *  for users who accidentally send to erroneous addresses or if they send too much.
 * @property {'retry'} RETRY - When a transaction is failed it can be retried by
 *  resubmitting the same transaction with a higher gas fee. This type is also used
 *  to speed up pending transactions. This is accomplished by creating a new tx with
 *  the same nonce and higher gas fees.
