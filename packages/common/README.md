The [MetaMask browser extension](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension) is a crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps.

The [MetaMask Desktop app](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-desktop) is one of many experiments we are exploring to improve our extension-driven experiences. The Desktop app improves the overall performance of the extension when using the [Flask build](https://metamask.io/flask/).

This package contains the functions and classes needed to pair the MetaMask browser extension with the MetaMask Desktop app.
